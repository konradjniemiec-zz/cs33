First, I had no idea what to do, so I was looking up Lisp instructions and
trying to figure out what in the world Ftimes was. Finally, after some help
from Piazza, I got a bit of a hint and used the correct gdb start code:
gdb --args ~eggert/bin32/bin/emacs-24.5 -batch -eval '(print (* 37 -26))'
after navigating to the proper source code.
I then used layout split to see both the source, set one breakpoint at
Ftimes with 'b Ftimes' then ran the code, with 'r'. To step through each
machine instruction I used 'si' or 'stepi' and to examine registers I used
'p/x $eax' and for memory, 'x/x $esp' to see the data at the location pointed
to by esp. I used these to write all my traces, with a lot of copy pasting
and plenty of coffee. If I was better at python scripting I would write a
script to do this for me, and examine the registers and note the differences,
but alas, maybe for some other day. Note: some of the mov instructions did
not actually change the registers, they had the values in there before the
instruction was executed, therefore I left the third column blank for those.
